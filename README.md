# social-engeeniring
We will host the website project here, so we are not lost in all the updates and different files. 
Cheers!


Site updates: I have fixed all the page links, now the browsing just works. Sub-menu of the attacks pages sorted alphabeticly. I added the same style for it (radius corners), to stay on the theme. Fixed issue with Waterhole wideo not displaying. All embeded videos should go in a "div class="video box"" so it can be easier for Ala to style. 
  
Fixed the main menu page boxes, now they are clickable. Added social media buttons to the footer (got everything, but the tiktok account), and they could use some style.
