# social-engeeniring
We will host the website project here, so we are not lost in all the updates and different files. 
Cheers!


Site updates: I have fixed all the page links, now the browsing just works. Sub-menu of the attacks pages sorted alphabeticly. I added the same style for it (radius corners), to stay on the theme. Fixed issue with Waterhole wideo not displaying. All embeded videos should go in a "div class="video box"" so it can be easier for Ala to style. 
  
Adds social media buttons to the footer. Got everythiing, but tiktok account and could use some style.
